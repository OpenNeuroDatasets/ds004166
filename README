## Effects of Forward and Backward Span Trainings on Working Memory: Evidence from a Randomized, Controlled Trial

### Introduction

**Overview:** Both forward and backward working memory span tasks have been used in cognitive training, but no study has
 been conducted to test whether the two types of trainings are equally effective. Based on data from a larger randomized
 controlled trial, this study tested the effects of backward span training, forward span training, and no intervention. 
Event-related potential (ERP) signals were recorded at the pre-, mid-, and post-tests while the subjects were performing 
a distractor version of the change detection task, which included three conditions (2 targets and 0 distractor [2T0D];
 4 targets and 0 distractor [4T0D]; and 2 targets and 2 distractors [2T2D]). Behavioral data were collected from two additional
 tasks: a multi-object version of the change detection task, and a suppress task. Compared to no intervention, both forward 
and backward span trainings led to significantly greater improvement in working memory maintenance, based on indices from 
both behavioral (Kmax) and ERP data (CDA_2T0D and CDA_4T0D). Backward span training also improved interference control based 
on the ERP data (CDA_filtering efficiency) to a greater extent than did forward span training and no intervention, but the three groups 
did not differ in terms of behavioral indices of interference control. These results have potential implications for optimizing the current 
cognitive training on working memory.

### Methods   

**Subjects:** Volunteers from university recruited through advertisements.  
 
**Apparatus:**  At all three time points (pre-, mid-, and post-tests), we used a 64-channel Synamps RT system (Neuroscan, El Paso, USA) 
to record the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Subjects were required to sit in a comfortable chair inside a darkened, electrically shielded 
recording chamber during the EEG recording. The electrode impedance was low (below 5kÎ©). The reference electrode was on the left mastoid. 
Electrodes were set both below and above the right eye to record the vertical electrooculographies (EOGs). Electrodes were set at the outer canthi
 of each eye to record the horizontal EOGs. 
**EEG dataset:** Backward group (sub-01~sub020);  Forward group (sub-101~sub120); Control group (sub-201~sub220); Sudoku group (sub-301~sub320). 
                          Pre-test(ses-01); Mid-test(ses-01); Post-test(ses-01);
